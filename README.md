# Algorithmic-Complexity

## Intro

This Repo is a playground for me to get to grips with Algorithms and Complexity.

My understanding of:

- Algorithms are as a set of steps in turning an varying number of inputs into a desired output.
- Complexity
  - Time complexity
  - Space complexity

The efficiency of an Algorithm should be decided based on the `units of work` a computer needs to compute in order to achieve the desired output with the given inputs.

This is different to just assessing lines of code as, in a simplistic model, a method with 5 lines of code may only run once each (given a single input), but the same lines of code might run twice each (given 2 inputs, so now a total of 10 units of work), and could even start to exponentially increase from that point onwards.

## What to expect

I'll be:

- Creating a time measurement script to assess complexity of a given procedure
- Connecting Google Sheets to store and graph data
- Testing built in Ruby algorithms such as
  - last
  - reverse
  - shuffle
  - sort
- Creating my own algorithms to solve
